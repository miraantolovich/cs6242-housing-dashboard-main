This is the dashboard code for Team 127's CSE 6242 Project: Housing Market Dynamics

Make sure you have installed Flask web service (I ran everything locally on my laptop so I had to install Flask CORS to avoid potantial problems.)

In a Command Prompt, go to the folder that you have all the files and run the following command:
python app.py

This will start a local web server, typically at http://localhost:5000.

Next, from a second Command Prompt within the same folder as before, create a local host: python -m http.server 8000

Then from your localhost, you can open 'main-final.html'

You may follow the instructions located on the main page or select the Stats or Info pages in the top right corner for more information on the project.
