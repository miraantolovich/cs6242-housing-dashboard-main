                    <p><b><i>What is SARIMA?</i></b> ARIMA or autoregressive integrated moving
                    average is a forecasting method for univariate time series data. SARIMA is an extension of the
                     ARIMA method that supports time series data with a seasonal component. On the main page, our prediction 
                     graph using a SARIMA model displays the historic average house price for metros from 2000 through 
                    our predicted values for 2024.</p>
                    <p><b><i>Why did we choose to use SARIMA?</i></b> Through our analysis of the data,
                    we found that there was a seasonal aspect to monthly house pricing. In addition to this, SARIMA
                    is typically an easy to understand and interpret model, making it more useful for casual users 
                    than a complicated model. </p>
                    <p><b><i>How did we interpret significance of the model?</i></b> Using error metrics like MSE, MAE, 
                    and RMSE we found that the SARIMA model is not perfectly accurate but the model captured underlying
                    trends and patterns within the data.</p>

                    <p><b><i>What are Trends?</i></b> In analytics, Trends are long-term upward or downward changes
                    in the average  measured value. For our model on the main page, we showed the trends in regards to 
                    Employment, Population, and Average Price per state for each year from 2000-2020.</p>
                    <p><b><i>Why might it be useful to display Trends?</i></b> Housing prices can be heavily
                    influenced by multiple factors, so showing the factors that have the most weight in regards
                    to Trends can help a user better understand why our model predicts certain future prices.</p>
                    <p><b><i>How did you determine these factors were the most influential?</i></b> A regression 
                    analysis was performed with respect to house pricing and our results below indicated the most 
                    influential factors in house prices.</p>

                    <p><b><i>What is Multiple Regression Analysis?</i></b> Multiple regression analysis (MRA) is a 
                        statistical technique that analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more 
                        independent variables. MRA is widely used to identify the factors that influence the dependent 
                        variable and to predict its value based on the importance of the independent variables.</p>
                    <p><b><i>How was it applied for our project?</i></b> Our project used MRA to analyze the relationship 
                        between numerous factors that affect the price of housing, including GDP growth, mortgage rates, 
                        employment, population growth, income, crime rate, and more. Our model identified income, employment, 
                        and population growth as the key factors influencing housing prices after rigorous data screening 
                        and exploratory analysis.</p>
                    <p><b><i>How did we interpret significance of the model?</i></b> The metrics used to evaluate the model's 
                        accuracy are R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The relationship between these variables and 
                        housing prices was found to be strong, allowing the model to predict how these factors affect the 
                        housing market.</p>
